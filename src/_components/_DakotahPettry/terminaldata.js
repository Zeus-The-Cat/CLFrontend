 you about myself. I learned Front-End working on a
   senior design project that turned into a research grant to visualize
 geoJSON data, collected from the census, regarding demographics,
 property prices, and income distributions. Afterwards, I wanted to apply
  this work to publicly available federal legislative data, through my
  startup Clear Legislation, which also offered me the opportunity to
  work on my Back-End and DevOps skill set. I'm seeking employment as
  a Front-End developer focused on Web-Vitals and performance improvement,
  with the intention of eventually mastering Back-End later on in my
  career.`
